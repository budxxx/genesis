# Genesis - Web4 & Automation Showcase

Genesis is a Python-based automation tool designed to parse structured JSON data and transform it into a clean, responsive, and modern HTML dashboard. This project demonstrates the bridge between backend data processing and frontend presentation.

## 🚀 Overview
The core of this project is a script that takes complex information about **Web4 technologies** (decentralization, AI integration, immersive experiences) and a **WordPress installation guide**, processing them into a single, user-friendly web page.

## ✨ Key Features
* **JSON Parsing:** Efficiently handles nested data structures.
* **Automated HTML Generation:** Dynamically builds a web page structure using Python logic.
* **Modern UI/UX:** The generated output includes a built-in CSS stylesheet with:
    * Responsive design (mobile-friendly).
    * Clean typography (Arial/Sans-serif).
    * Modern shadow effects and card-based layout.
* **Documentation Automation:** Automatically generates a step-by-step guide for WordPress setup.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3
* **Data Format:** JSON

## 📂 Project Structure
* `genesis.py`: The main logic script containing the data and HTML generator.
* `web4_overview.html`: (Generated) The final output file for viewing in browsers.

## ⚙️ How to Use
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash

## 💡 Purpose
This repository serves as a demonstration of my ability to:
1. Handle data serialization/deserialization.
2. Automate repetitive tasks (like writing manual HTML).
3. Combine multiple technologies into a functional tool.
